                    The digital world is constantly evolving with new social media platforms, apps, and devices, and children and teens are often the first to use them. Some negative things that may occur include cyberbullying, sexting, posting hateful messages or content, and participating in negative group conversations. If your child posts harmful or negative content online, it may not only harm other children; it can affect their online reputation, which can have negative implications for their employment or college admission.

                    A child may be involved in cyberbullying in several ways. A child can be bullied, bully others, or witness bullying. Parents, teachers, and other adults may not be aware of all the social media platforms and apps that a child is using. The more digital platforms that a child uses, the more opportunities there are for being exposed to potential cyberbullying. 
                    <br>    <br>
                    Many of the warning signs that cyberbullying is occurring happen around a child’s use of their device. Since children spend a lot of time on their devices, increases or decreases in use may be less noticeable. It’s important to pay attention when a child exhibits sudden changes in digital and social behavior. Some of the warning signs that a child may be involved in cyberbullying are: 
                    <br>  <br>
                    1-Noticeable, rapid increases or decreases in device use, including texting. 
                    <br>   <br>
                    2-A child exhibits emotional responses to what is happening on their device. 
                    <br>      <br>
                    3-A child hides their screen or device when others are near, and avoids discussion about what they are doing on their device. 
                    <br>    <br>
                    4-Social media accounts are shut down or new ones appear. 
                    <br>     <br>
                    5-A child starts to avoid social situations, even those that were enjoyed in the past.
