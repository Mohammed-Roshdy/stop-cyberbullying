                Victims of in-game cyberbullying have reported verbal harassment in game lobbies and in-game chats, as well as having their gameplay experience targeted. The perpetrators of this negative behavior are often referred to as griefers. Griefing is the term given to any act in which a player sabotages or interferes with another player’s gameplay, steals their virtual belongings (aka greed play), deliberately irritates other players or verbally harasses others during in-game chats.
